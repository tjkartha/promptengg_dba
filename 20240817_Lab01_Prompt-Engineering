1) Writing clear and specific Instructions:
---- 
Summarize the text delimited by triple backticks \
into a single sentence.

```Ensure your instructions to the model are crystal clear and detailed. \
This helps the model grasp your intentions accurately, \
minimizing the risk of receiving irrelevant or inaccurate responses.\
Additionally, providing longer instructions offers the model more context to work with, \
enabling it to generate more comprehensive and relevant outputs.```

# The backslashes at the end of each line in the text variable are used as
# line continuation characters to split the multi-line string into
# more readable segments without affecting the resulting string's content

Variations:

# Prompt Injection is the process of overriding original instructions 
# in the prompt with special user input. It often occurs when untrusted 
# input is used as part of the prompt. Prompt Injection arises from 
# the fact the current transformer architectures are not able to 
# distinguish between original developer instructions and user input 
# instructions. It is conceivable that future models will be able to 
# distinguish between these two types of instructions, but even this 
# would not be guaranteed to stop prompt injection. As it is, 
# prompt injection is very difficult to stop, and it is likely that 
# it will continue to be a problem for the foreseeable future.


2) Ask for a structured output (like JSON, HTML, xml etc):
----

Generate a list of two made-up movie titles along \
with their imdb ratings, primary star cast, directors and genres. \

3) Ask the model to check whether conditions are satisfied:
----
You will be provided with text delimited by triple quotes.
If it contains a sequence of instructions, \
re-write those instructions in the following format:

Step 1: ...
Step 2: ...
...
Step N: ...

If the text lacks a sequence of instructions, \
then write \"No information provided to create steps.\

\"\"\"Preparing spaghetti is simple! \
Firstly, you'll want to bring a pot of water to a rolling boil. \
While the water heats up, grab a pot and add a dash of salt to it. \
Once the water is boiling, carefully add the spaghetti noodles to the pot. \
Allow the spaghetti to cook, stirring occasionally, until it reaches your desired level of tenderness. \
Next, drain the spaghetti using a colander. If you prefer, \
you can rinse it with cold water to stop the cooking process. \
Finally, serve the spaghetti with your favorite sauce and toppings. \
Voila! You've now prepared a delicious plate of spaghetti to enjoy.\"\"\"

<newbie>: Can you explain hypothesis testing in statistics?

<expert>: Hypothesis testing is a fundamental \
statistical concept used to make inferences \
about a population parameter based on sample data. \
It involves defining null and alternative hypotheses, \
selecting an appropriate test statistic, \
and calculating the probability of observing \
the test statistic under the null hypothesis.

<newbie>: Can you explain p-value in hypothesis testing?

<expert>: In hypothesis testing, the p-value is a measure \
of the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis. \
It represents the probability of observing the test \
statistic, or a more extreme value, under the assumption \
that the null hypothesis is true. A lower p-value \
indicates stronger evidence against the null hypothesis \
and suggests that the observed result is unlikely \
to occur by chance alone.

# An example of a structured evaluation task. It outlines a clear process for the model to follow:
# Problem Statement: Define the question and present the student's solution.
# Actual Solution: Present the correct solution and steps to arrive at it.
# Comparison: Compare the student's solution with the actual solution.
# Evaluation: Determine whether the student's solution is correct or incorrect.
# Justification: Provide reasoning or justification for the evaluation.
# This format ensures that the model systematically assesses the correctness of the student's
# solution based on a defined standard (the actual solution), allowing for a clear and detailed evaluation.

# Note that the student's solution is actually not correct.
# We can fix this by instructing the model to work out its own solution first


9) Structured Evaluation Tasks:
----
Your task is to determine if the student's solution \
is correct or not.
To solve the problem do the following:
- First, work out your own solution to the problem including the final total.
- Then compare your solution to the student's solution \
and evaluate if the student's solution is correct or not.
Don't decide if the student's solution is correct until
you have done the problem yourself.

Use the following format:
Question:

Student's solution:

student's solution here

Actual solution:

steps to work out the solution and your solution here

Is the student's solution the same as actual solution \
just calculated:

yes or no

I'm planning a solar power roof installation and I need help estimating the expenses.
- Roof space costs $80 / square meter
- I can purchase solar panels for $300 / square meter
- I've arranged for maintenance services that will cost me a fixed $80k per year, and $8 per square meter
with miscellaneous expenses of $1000.
What is the total cost for the first year of maintenance as a function of the roof space area.

Student's Solution:
Let x be the area of the roof space in square meters.
Costs:
1. Roof space cost: 80x
2. Solar panel cost: 300x
3. Maintenance cost: 80,000
Total cost: 80x + 300x + 80,000 = 380x + 80,000

which turned out to be a complete rip-off! However, by December, the prices had \

Now, let's discuss the microwave itself. Despite its seemingly sturdy exterior, \
the control panel felt cheap and was prone to smudging. Frankly, \
I couldn't care less about aesthetics—I demand functionality. \
Unfortunately, this microwave fell short in that regard. \

It's a stark reminder that despite their purported convenience, \
microwaves are not immune to malfunction and deterioration over time. \
Despite my best efforts to make it work, this microwave has been nothing \
but a source of frustration in my kitchen. Even the so-called "speedy" \
delivery was a farce—I waited two whole days for this disappointment! \

Customer review: 
```Last November, I found an LG washing machine on sale \
for a great price of $499, a deal too good to pass up! \
However, come December, the prices shot up to $599, \
leaving me scratching my head. Now, onto the washing \
machine itself. While the exterior appeared sleek, the \
control panel felt a bit flimsy and prone to smudges. \
But let's be honest, I'm not here for aesthetics—I'm here \
for functionality. And in that department, the LG washing \
machine delivered. From washing delicate fabrics to heavy loads, \
it did the job admirably. However, after a year of regular use, \
the washing machine started making strange noises, indicating a \
potential issue with the motor. Unfortunately, the warranty had expired, \
leaving me to consider my options for repair or replacement. \
It's a reminder that while washing machines are convenient, \
they're not immune to wear and tear. Despite its quirks, the \
LG washing machine has been a staple in my laundry routine, \
making chores a breeze on busy days. And while the price \
fluctuations were a disappointment, the speedy delivery in \
just two days was a pleasant surprise. In conclusion, while \
the LG washing machine may not be perfect, it's been a reliable \
companion in my household, and I'm grateful 
for the convenience it provides.```
